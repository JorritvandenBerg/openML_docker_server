OpenML: Open Machine Learning
=============================


## Aim
OpenML aims to create a novel ecosystem for machine learning experimentation. The current generation of machine learning 
and data mining platforms offers a wide variety of algorithms to process and model all kinds of data. They also offer 
convenient ways for running many experiments to assess, select and fine-tune algorithm performance and optimize workflows. 
On the whole, however, users only have access to their own experiments: there is no global repository for machine learning 
experiments, nor a standardized way to share experiments with other users. This means that a lot of valuable knowledge 
about machine learning techniques is lost. OpenML is a platform to share detailed experimental 
results with the community at large and organize them for future reuse. Moreover, it will be directly integrated in 
todayâ€™s most popular data mining tools (for now: R, KNIME, RapidMiner and WEKA). Such an easy and free exchange of 
experiments has tremendous potential to speed up machine learning research, to engender larger, more detailed studies 
and to offer accurate advice to practitioners. Finally, it will also be a valuable resource for education in machine 
learning and data mining.

## How does it work?
OpenML works much like a data mining challenge platform, such as Kaggle, except that solutions are constructed collaboratively, with anybody free to build on other people's work, instead of a competition setting, where all progress is kept secret.
